The Connected Accounts service allows you to pair accounts of various social networks with blockchain accounts. Thus, the user can create his own network of accounts, which can be represented as a graph.

Types of links that can be created at the moment:

- NEAR Testnet + Twitter
- NEAR Testnet + GitHub
- NEAR Testnet + Ethereum (using MetaMask signature)
- NEAR Mainnet + Twitter
- NEAR Mainnet + GitHub
- NEAR Mainnet + Ethereum (using MetaMask signature)
- Twitter + GitHub

Currently you can see your connected accounts in our [Mutable Web extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/mutable-web/cnahdmdbhkphpbpbjjbfdnmbphbenglc) on Profile page.
